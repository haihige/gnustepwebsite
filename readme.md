# GNUstep Home Page

An open-source implementation of Cocoa, GNUstep is an API with an elegant design for building beautiful, cross-platform applications quickly.

_Apps running on Mac, Linux/BSD, and Windows; though they can also run on many other platforms._

Apps use the native interface on Mac out of the box. They can run on [Windows](docs#windows). Cocoa compatibility is up to macOS 10.15, and software developed using GNUstep can be built on [macOS](docs#mac) using Xcode.

Themes can be designed for Linux/BSD using the theming engine [Thematic](gallery/theming). Flexible enough to produce an original skin from scratch, or a familiar theme reminiscent of Platinum, Aqua, or the classic Windows 95.
